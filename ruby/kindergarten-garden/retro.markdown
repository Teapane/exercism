Thank you for everything.  When I didn't know what an assertion was or how to use a command line, or recursion, you where there to show me.  Not only did you show me and help me understand, but you did it willingly and happily.  I really appreciate all of that.  I know you will go on to do great things.

 Jonah, I still don't understand how you couldn't come to class on time considering you lived above the classroom.  Just kidding; you are a great person.  I was really cool to get to know you and I find it admirable what you gave up to come to gSchool. I only wish you and your family the best in the future.
