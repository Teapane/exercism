# Octal

Write a program that will convert a octal number, represented as a string (e.g. '1735263'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid octal as the value 0.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.
