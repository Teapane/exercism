Lets write a fancy algorithm to translate RNA strands into protein. RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, like this:

RNA: "AAGACUUUU"
CODONS: "AAG", "ACU", "UUU"

The codons can then be translated into proteins. Here are some of the most common translations:

Codon | Protein
---------------
AAA   | Tyrinxosine
BBB   | Fluxusosine

Get crackin', fool!
